# Description
## *Sentiment-Analysis-and-Stock-Returns-Visualization*


### This Python script performs sentiment analysis on news articles related to a company (e.g., Nvidia) and compares the sentiment scores with stock price returns. It uses the NewsAPI to fetch recent news headlines and the HuggingFace sentiment analysis model to calculate sentiment scores (positive or negative) for each article. The sentiment scores are then aggregated by date. The script fetches stock data using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and calculates daily stock returns. Finally, it merges sentiment data with stock returns and visualizes both metrics in a dual-plot layout, showing the correlation between news sentiment and stock performance.
